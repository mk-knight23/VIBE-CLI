## Core Capabilities

### 8 Primitives

Vibe CLI uses 8 unified primitives instead of 60+ scattered tools:

1. **Ask** - Answer questions, explain code
2. **Code** - Generate, refactor, complete code
3. **Debug** - Fix bugs, trace execution
4. **Test** - Write and run tests
5. **Deploy** - Build, ship, release
6. **Agent** - Run autonomous multi-step tasks
7. **Memory** - Remember project context
8. **Plan** - Design architecture, roadmaps

### Multi-Agent System

Built-in agents for specialized tasks:

- **PlannerAgent** - Creates execution plans
- **ExecutorAgent** - Runs code and commands
- **ReviewerAgent** - Validates outputs
- **TestAgent** - Generates and runs tests
- **SecurityAgent** - Vulnerability scanning
- **RollbackAgent** - Reverts changes
- **MemoryAgent** - Manages project context

### Intent-Driven Interface

Natural language classification into 16 categories:

- question, code_generation, refactor, debug
- testing, api, ui, deploy, infra
- memory, planning, agent, git
- analysis, security

### Workflow Engine

Built-in workflows for common tasks:

- **CI/CD** - install → lint → test → build → deploy
- **Code Review** - analyze → security → test → report
