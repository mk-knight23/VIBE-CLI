## 📋 Features

### Modes
Modes are managed in the extension backend and surfaced in the webview:

- **Architect (🏗️)** — plan and design
- **Code (💻)** — write & refactor code
- **Ask (❓)** — Q&A and explanations
- **Debug (🪲)** — diagnose & fix issues
- **Orchestrator (🪃)** — coordinate multi-step workflows
- **Project Research (🔍)** — analyze and summarize the codebase

Mode state is stored in the extension host and updated via webview messages (see mode handling in `src/extension.ts`).

### Personas
Personas tailor the assistant behavior per mode:

- **Balanced** — general purpose
- **System Architect** — high-level design
- **Pair Programmer** — implementation-focused
- **Debug Doctor** — debugging expert
- **Research Analyst** — codebase research

Personas are defined in `src/extension.ts` and applied in a synthesized system prompt per request.

### Chat vs Agent Tabs
The webview UI provides:

- **Chat tab** — direct conversational usage
- **Agent tab** — agent-style behavior, emphasizing checkpoints & todo planning

Agent/tab selection is handled fully in the webview script and included in the message payload to the backend (see `isAgent` handling in `src/extension.ts`).

## 🔧 Technical Details

### AI Provider Integration
- Supports both OpenRouter and MegaLLM APIs
- OpenRouter: Uses fetch to call `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
- MegaLLM: Uses fetch to call `https://ai.megallm.io/v1/chat/completions`
- Default model: `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free`
- Several top models from both providers are exposed in a dropdown for quick switching (see `TOP_FREE_MODELS` in `src/extension.ts`)
- The API calling wrappers live in `callOpenRouter(...)` and `callMegaLLM(...)` in `src/extension.ts`

### Settings
Extension settings (via VS Code Settings UI or `settings.json`):

- `vibe.provider` (string) — AI provider to use (options: "openrouter", "megallm")
- `vibe.openrouterApiKey` (string) — your OpenRouter API key
- `vibe.megallmApiKey` (string) — your MegaLLM API key
- `vibe.defaultModel` (string) — default model id (defaults to `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free`)
- `vibe.autoApproveUnsafeOps` (boolean) — future toggle for auto-approving risky operations
- `vibe.maxContextFiles` (number) — maximum files considered for context collection

Configuration schema is defined in `package.json`.

### Provider Selection
The extension now supports both OpenRouter and MegaLLM providers. You can switch between providers in the settings panel or using the provider dropdown in the sidebar. Each provider requires its own API key.

### UI & UX Improvements
- **Enhanced Scrolling:** Smooth scrolling with custom-styled scrollbars
- **Message Copying:** Click on any message to copy its content
- **Clear Chat:** One-click button to clear conversation history
- **Responsive Design:** Better layout and spacing for improved readability
- **Auto-scroll Control:** Smart auto-scroll that respects manual scrolling

### Context Button
Context button collects snippets from visible editors (URI, language, first 4k chars) and surfaces them in the sidebar.
Implementation: `handleRequestContext` in `src/extension.ts`.
This mimics Vibe-CLI's context injection but is scoped to open editors to keep it safe and predictable.

## ⌨️ Commands & Keybindings

Commands are contributed in `package.json`:

- **Vibe: Open Chat** (`vibe.openChat`) — opens the main Vibe panel in Code mode
- **Vibe: Open Agent Panel** (`vibe.openAgent`) — opens the panel in Architect mode
- **Vibe: Open Settings** (`vibe.openSettings`) — jumps to Vibe's settings section
- **Vibe: Next Mode** (`⌘+.`) (`vibe.switchNextMode`)
- **Vibe: Previous Mode** (`⌘+Shift+.`) (`vibe.switchPrevMode`)

**Keybindings** (when Vibe panel is visible):
- **Next mode:** `⌘ + .` (macOS) / `Ctrl + .`
- **Previous mode:** `⌘ + ⇧ + .` / `Ctrl + ⇧ + .`

See the registration logic in `activate(...)` in `src/extension.ts`.

## 🏗️ Building & Running

From this subdirectory (`vibe-code/`):

```bash
npm install
npm run compile      # builds to ./dist
```

To develop or debug in VS Code:

1. Open this folder in VS Code
2. Run "Launch Extension" debug configuration (you may need to create `.vscode/launch.json`)
3. In Extension Development Host:
   - Open the Command Palette
   - Run "Vibe: Open Chat" or "Vibe: Open Agent Panel"
   - Set your `vibe.openrouterApiKey` in Settings and start chatting

## 📦 Packaging for Marketplace

To build a `.vsix` package:

```bash
npm run compile
npx @vscode/vsce package
```

That will produce `vibe-vscode-*.vsix`, which you can:

- **Install locally:** Command Palette → Extensions: Install from VSIX...
- **Upload to the VS Code Marketplace** under your publisher (`mktech` as in `package.json`)

## 🚀 Versioning & Release

- Maintain backward compatibility

## 📝 Notes & Architecture

This release focuses on:

- 🎯 **Solid Foundation:** Reliable chat panel with modes/personas
- 🔗 **Ecosystem Integration:** Compatible with Vibe CLI and Web
- 🎨 **Extensible Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns
- 🛡️ **Privacy-First:** Local processing with optional cloud features
- ⚡ **Performance:** Optimized for minimal resource usage

Most behavior is orchestrated in `src/extension.ts`; new features should be added there using the existing webview messaging pattern (see `handleMessage` and the inline webview script).
